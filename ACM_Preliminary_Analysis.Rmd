This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
data = as.tbl(read.csv("student-por.csv", sep=";", stringsAsFactors=TRUE))
```

###Rename the Variables

```{r}

rename_cols <- c(4:12,16:21,23:24,26:28,31:33)

colnames(data)[rename_cols] = c("urban_rural",
                                "fam_size",
